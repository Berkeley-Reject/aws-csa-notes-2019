//! `rust-kernel-riscv` is an open-source project that implements an operating system kernel on RISC-V architecture with Rust programming language. The project draws inspiration from several open-source implementations, such as [xv6-riscv](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) and [zCore](https://github.com/rcore-os/zCore).
//!
//! - The kernel leverages Rust's asynchronous programming model to schedule threads in both the
//!   kernel and user space, which makes context switching more efficient and eliminates the need of
//!   allocating a separate kernel stack for each user process.
//!
//! - The kernel implements the kernel page-table isolation, which prevents the kernel space and the
//!   user space to share a same page table and mitigates potential Meltdown attacks.
