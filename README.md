# `rust-kernel-riscv`

`rust-kernel-riscv` is an open source project that implements an operating system kernel on RISC-V architecture with Rust programming language. The project draws inspiration from several open source implementations like [xv6-riscv](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) and [rCore](https://github.com/rcore-os/rCore).

## Development Roadmap

- [x] Privilege level separation
- [x] Page table
- [x] Kernel page table isolation
- [x] Asynchronous thread scheduling
- [ ] TCP/IP stack
- [ ] Virtio driver
- [ ] Linux-compatible system call interface
- [ ] [musl libc-test](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/libc-test.html)
